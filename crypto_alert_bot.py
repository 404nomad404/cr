    Identify Buy/Sell/Hold signals based on multiple technical indicators.

    The function analyzes key technical indicators, including:
    - EMA crossovers
    - Support & Resistance levels
    - Trend analysis (using EMA alignment & ADX)
    - RSI overbought/oversold conditions
    - Breakout detection
    - Market sentiment (from Binance funding rates)
    - Whale activity detection

    A final status (BUY, SELL, or HOLD) is determined using a Confirmation-Based Strategy:
    - At least 2 buy/sell signals must align before confirming a trade.
    - Trend strength and volume are factored in to avoid false signals.
