## ðŸ“Œ How This Works

- ChatGPT assisted
- It sends alerts based on EMA crossovers, RSI insights, and support/resistance levels, 
ensuring strong entry/exit points while preventing false breakouts.
-   Sends alerts to Telegram
    - Prevents spam by only sending alerts when conditions change  
    - Uses Markdown in Telegram for better readability

-   Uses Binance WebSockets for real-time updates. Its public API allows users to access market data, such as price and trading volume, WITHOUT any cost
-   Runs continuously, checking the market every 15 minutes 

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

1.	Create a Binance API Key https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management

    - BotFather will send you a unique API token
3. To create a chat ID 
    - Create a new chat group
    - Add your bot to the group
    - Go to Telegram Web and log in to your account

    - The chat ID (numbers/digits) is in the URL in the address bar
4. Install the required Python libraries:
```

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Bots

##### 1. Replace API Keys in settings.py:

- 	Add your Binance API keys (api_key, api_secret)
- 	Add your Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID
```
# ----------------------------------------------
# Binance API Configuration (Public API)
BINANCE_API_KEY = ""  
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY = ""
# ----------------------------------------------
# Telegram Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = ""
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "1234567899"  # example
```
##### 2. Replace crypto-pair in settings.py:

## ðŸ“Œ What I DID NOT DO
- Add automatic order execution to buy/sell directly on Binance. 
- Can do if there's a safe sandbox i can play around. Do it manually-lah for now, jgn malas ðŸ˜‚
 
## ðŸ“Œ R&D
- Support/Resistance Levels (DONE)
    >Support and resistance (S/R) levels help confirm buy/sell signals by identifying key price areas where the market has historically reversed or consolidated. Adding them to EMA-based strategy can:

    >âœ… Increase Trade Accuracy â€“ Prevent false breakouts
    
    >âœ… Confirm Buy/Sell Signals â€“ Only trade when price respects key levels
    
    >âœ… Identify Strong Entry & Exit Points â€“ Buy near support, sell near resistance
    
    >âœ… Detect Trend Reversals â€“ When price breaks through strong S/R levels

- RSI for Overbought/Oversold Conditions (DONE)
  >-If RSI is above 50, it suggests bullish momentumâ€”strengthening buy signals.
  >
  >-if RSI is below 50, it suggests bearish momentumâ€”validating sell signals.

- backtest (In progress)
    - Loads historical Binance data
    - Applies EMA crossovers, Support/Resistance, RSI rules
    - Simulate buy/sell trades as per recipe in bot
    - Calculates balance, total profit/loss, win rate, and performance metrics
    - Trade Log (timestamps & prices)
    - Graph with buy/sell signals (matplotlib)
    - Tune recipe with chatgpt
  

  *Some initial backtesting results:*
  ```
  INITIAL_BALANCE = 1000
  INTERVAL = "1d"  # Backtest on 1d candles
  LIMIT = 1000  # Number of historical candles to fetch
  ```
