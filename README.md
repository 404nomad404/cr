# ðŸ“Š Crypto Monitoring & Alert Bot ðŸš€  

## Overview  
This Python script integrates **Binance API** and **Telegram** to monitor cryptocurrency prices, detect trading signals, and send real-time alerts with price charts. 

It helps traders identify **EMA crossovers, RSI signals, and trend strength** to make informed trading decisions.  

## ðŸ”¥ Features  


### âœ… **Real-time Market Monitoring**
- Fetches historical price data from Binance every 15 minutes.
- Supports multiple crypto pairs (configurable in settings.SYMBOLS).

### âœ… **Technical Indicators & Trend Analysis**
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**  
  - Detects key **EMA crossovers** (7, 21, 50, 100, 200).  
  - Identifies **Golden Cross** (Bullish) and **Death Cross** (Bearish).
  - Filters EMA cross signals with RSI (trend strength) and ADX (momentum)
    
  - #### ðŸ”¥ How This Improves Decision Making

| **EMA Crossover**                    | **BUY Alert**                    | **SELL Alert**                    | **Why It Matters**                    |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **EMA100/EMA200** (Golden/Death Cross) | *EMA100 crossed above EMA200*   | *EMA100 crossed below EMA200*   | **Strong long-term trend change**  |
| **EMA50/EMA100**                      | *EMA50 crossed above EMA100*    | *EMA50 crossed below EMA100*    | **Medium-term trend confirmation** |
| **EMA21/EMA50**                        | *EMA21 crossed above EMA50*     | *EMA21 crossed below EMA50*     | **Early medium-term trend shift**  |
| **EMA7/EMA21**                         | *EMA7 crossed above EMA21*      | *EMA7 crossed below EMA21*      | **Short-term momentum change**     |


- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
  - RSI-based alerts for momentum-based trades
  - Alerts when **RSI is oversold (<30) â†’ Buy Signal**.  
  - Alerts when **RSI is overbought (>70) â†’ Sell Signal**.
  - Adjusts RSI buy/sell levels dynamically based on trend conditions
- **Average Directional Index (ADX)**
  - Implements ADX (Average Directional Index) to confirm trend strength.
  - Adding trend detection can help you:
    
	>âœ… Avoid bad trades by filtering weak signals.
 	>
	>âœ… Confirm strong buy/sell signals based on trend strength.
  	>
	>âœ… Hold your position instead of reacting to every small price movement.
  - Identifies Strong Uptrend, Strong Downtrend, or Weak/Ranging Markets using EMA alignment and ADX strength.
  - Determines if a trend is **strong (ADX > 25)** or **weak/ranging (ADX < 20)**.
  - Prevents false signals by avoiding trades in weak-trend conditions.
- **Support & Resistance Detection**
  - Detects **price near support (Buy Zone) or resistance (Sell Zone)**.

- **Volume-Based Signal Validation**
  - Confirms breakouts using moving average of volume.
  - Compute Volume Moving Average (20-period)
    
	â€¢	EMA7 & EMA21 â†’ Confirms short-term momentum shifts.

	â€¢	EMA21 & EMA50 â†’ Mid-term confirmation of trend changes.

	â€¢	Volume Surge â†’ Ensures crossovers are not false signals.
 
### ðŸ“¡ **Automated Real-Time Alerts via Telegram**
- Sends **clear and meaningful** alerts in **Markdown format**.  
- Prevents **spam** by sending alerts only when conditions change.  
- Includes **price chart images** for better visualization.  

### âš¡ **Reliable Execution & Async Handling**
- Handles **async Telegram alerts** to avoid `asyncio` issues.  
- Uses **error handling** to prevent failures when sending messages.  
- Monitors multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously.


## ðŸš€ How It Works  
1. Fetches **live price data** from Binance API every 15 minutes.  
2. Computes **technical indicators (EMA, RSI, ADX, Support/Resistance)**.  
3. Detects **buy/sell signals** based on indicator crossovers & trend confirmation.  
4. Sends **real-time alerts to Telegram** with price charts.
5. The system ensures alerts are only sent when new conditions appear to prevent redundant notifications.

## ðŸ“‚ **Setup Instructions**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas numpy matplotlib python-telegram-bot
2.  To create a Telegram bot token
    - Open the Telegram app
    - Search for "@BotFather"
    - Start a chat with BotFather
    - Type /newbot
    - Follow the instructions to name and username your bot
    - BotFather will send you a unique API token
3. To create a chat ID
    - Create a new chat group
    - Add your bot to the group
    - Go to Telegram Web and log in to your account
    - Select the group chat
    - The chat ID (numbers/digits) is in the URL in the address bar
4.  Set up Telegram Bot in `settings.py`
   ```python
# settings.py

# ðŸ”¹ Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token"  # Replace with your Telegram Bot Token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id"  # Replace with your Telegram Chat ID

# ðŸ”¹ List of Cryptos to Monitor
SYMBOLS = ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "BNBUSDT"]  # Add more symbols
```
	

5. **Run the BOT**
Once everything is set up, run the script using:

```bash
python crypto_alert_bot.py
```

ðŸ“Œ Example Telegram Alert:

	âœ… Sends a message with price trend alerts.

	âœ… Attaches a small trend chart showing the last 50 candles.

	âœ… Helps visualize price movement before making decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ FUTURE BOT IDEAS

1. **Trade Confidence & Signal Strength**

	âœ… Signal Strength Meter â€“ Assign confidence levels to signals (e.g., weak/medium/strong) based on multiple confirmations.

	âœ… Trend Score â€“ Score from 1 to 100 based on EMAs, RSI, and momentum. Helps gauge bullish/bearish strength.


2. **Additional Market Insights**

	âœ… Volume Analysis â€“ Identify spikes in buying/selling volume to confirm trend strength. (Done)

		Compute Volume Moving Average (20-period)
			â€¢	EMA7 & EMA21 â†’ Confirms short-term momentum shifts.
			â€¢	EMA21 & EMA50 â†’ Mid-term confirmation of trend changes.
			â€¢	Volume Surge â†’ Ensures crossovers are not false signals.

	âœ… Volatility Indicator â€“ Show if the market is trending or ranging to avoid fakeouts.

	âœ… MACD Indicator â€“ Add another confirmation layer to trend shifts.


4. **Improved Alerts & Decision Support**

	âœ… Risk/Reward Estimation â€“ Suggest optimal entry price, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.

	âœ… Support/Resistance Breakout Detection â€“ Alert when price breaks past key levels instead of just touching them. (Done)

		Why is Breakout Detection Important?

			1.	Prevents False Signals â€“ Many times, the price tests a support/resistance level but reverses quickly. A proper breakout confirmation helps you avoid fakeouts.
			2.	Stronger Trend Confirmation â€“ When price breaks a key level with volume and momentum, it often signals a strong trend continuation or reversal.
			3.	Better Trade Timing â€“ Waiting for a confirmed breakout can help enter trades at the right time instead of getting caught in a range.

	âœ… Whale Activity Alert â€“ Detect unusual buy/sell volume spikes indicating large trader moves. (Done)

	âœ… Market Sentiment Check â€“ Integrate data from sources like Binance funding rates to gauge trader sentiment.



5. User Customization

	âœ… Adjustable Thresholds â€“ Allow you to tweak RSI, EMA crossovers, and risk levels dynamically.

	âœ… Multi-Crypto Filtering â€“ Rank and sort monitored cryptos based on trend strength.
